# Shoppies App by Anand Issac
This app is my submission for the Shopify Summer 2021 Front End Developer Challenge. 

It includes:
Expected functionality:
 - Search bar which searches for and displays movies (OMDB API)
 - Ability to nominate at most 5 movies 
 - View list of films nominated
 - Disabled button if movie is already nominated
 - Remove nominations from list
 
 Additional features:
 - View details about movies with a modal that displays information such as plot, rating, and genre (along with a cool poster of the movie!)
 - Exception handling which handles for incomplete information (missing plot, missing rating, missing poster etc.)
 - Error handling (search result bears nothing)
 - Tag that informs user that only 5 movies can be nominated + "thank you" modal
 - All buttons to nominate movies are disabled when user nominates 5 movies
 
 This challenge was really fun to work on; it gave me an amazing experience to think about user-focused design and helped me develop my front-end React.js skills. 
 If you would like to connect with me (or perhaps have a virtual coffee chat), please contact me at anand.z.issac@gmail.com or call me at 647-901-8340!!

Best wishes,
Anand Issac

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
