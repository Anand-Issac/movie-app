# Shoppies App by Anand Issac 

This app is my submission for the Shopify Summer 2021 Front End Developer Challenge. All the code is located inside shopify-movie-app.

# The application is hosted on Heroku; here is the link: https://shoppies-app-anand.herokuapp.com/


It includes:

Expected functionality:

  - Search bar which searches for and displays movies (OMDB API)
  - Ability to nominate at most 5 movies
  - View list of films nominated
  - Disabled button if movie is already nominated
  - Remove nominations from list

Additional features:

  - View details about movies with a modal that displays information such as plot, rating, and genre (along with a cool poster of the movie!)
  - Exception handling which handles for incomplete information (missing plot, missing rating, missing poster etc.)
  - Error handling (search result bears nothing)
  - Tag that informs user that only 5 movies can be nominated + "thank you" modal
  - All buttons to nominate movies are disabled when user nominates 5 movies
  
This challenge was really fun to work on; it gave me an amazing experience to think about user-focused design and helped me develop my front-end React.js skills. If you would like to connect with me (or perhaps have a virtual coffee chat), please contact me at anand.z.issac@gmail.com or call me at 647-901-8340!!

Best wishes,
